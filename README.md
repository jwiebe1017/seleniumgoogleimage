# Selenium Google Image
This little tool will utilize selenium to perform google image search and store the photos into a designated area  
provided by the user in the config (change that? who knows when you read this...)  

Ultimately - I want to service a ml model by serving it images from the web for training as opposed to  
building a biased model utilizing only me as its training reference.
